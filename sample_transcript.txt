137
00:08:14.722 --> 00:08:18.301
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Coming down, it's leaking, and my whole wall is wet.


138
00:08:18.872 --> 00:08:19.442
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


139
00:08:19.442 --> 00:08:22.062
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: And the next morning, the roofers were here.


140
00:08:22.062 --> 00:08:22.942
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


141
00:08:23.842 --> 00:08:24.822
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


142
00:08:25.322 --> 00:08:25.832
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah.


143
00:08:25.832 --> 00:08:31.642
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Okay, and so then, what about your family?


144
00:08:31.972 --> 00:08:33.642
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: What about my family?


145
00:08:34.592 --> 00:08:37.302
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Who are the most important people in your life?


146
00:08:37.302 --> 00:08:39.081
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Well, you and Jason.


147
00:08:42.142 --> 00:08:42.892
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


148
00:08:43.072 --> 00:08:46.161
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: My primary… my primary people.


149
00:08:47.012 --> 00:08:53.521
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Jason's 2 hours away, and I'm… 8 hours away by plane.


150
00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:55.221
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: or a Zoom call.


151
00:08:55.512 --> 00:08:56.832
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


152
00:08:56.832 --> 00:09:01.761
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah, we do… we did Zoom… we have Zoomed quite a bit, or FaceTimed with the kids.


153
00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:08.402
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: And then, of course, like, my grandchildren and stuff like that, but it's like…


154
00:09:08.522 --> 00:09:17.381
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: you know, I did look at some of those questions, and then I thought about… there was a question, can't remember exactly what it was.


155
00:09:17.902 --> 00:09:18.392
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Like…


156
00:09:18.392 --> 00:09:19.661
Sarah Stuckey Coates: We'll get to it, yeah.


157
00:09:19.662 --> 00:09:27.981
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Alright, but it was like, do the… are the grandchildren involved in that? And maybe they would be at some point, you know? Where, like.


158
00:09:28.872 --> 00:09:39.332
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: you know, Sam moves down the street from me or something, and I'm really old, and he helps me carry in the wood so his grandmother doesn't freeze to death.


159
00:09:39.332 --> 00:09:42.312
Sarah Stuckey Coates: with the work.


160
00:09:42.312 --> 00:09:49.351
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: You know, definitely… so I would just say, you know, my children and their families.


161
00:09:49.802 --> 00:09:50.532
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


162
00:09:50.752 --> 00:09:52.222
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: What is that?


163
00:09:52.222 --> 00:09:53.602
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Lavender.


164
00:09:53.922 --> 00:09:55.012
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Oh, okay.


165
00:09:56.872 --> 00:09:58.412
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: In the heart or something.


166
00:09:58.412 --> 00:10:01.672
Sarah Stuckey Coates: What? No.


167
00:10:01.972 --> 00:10:10.091
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: So, you know, I… times change, and I… so I thought about that, and I didn't list the grandchildren, because…


168
00:10:10.092 --> 00:10:10.572
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


169
00:10:10.572 --> 00:10:14.742
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: I'm like… My children are, like, the first…


170
00:10:15.172 --> 00:10:21.952
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: I mean, that's the key to the rest of the… my… my family, my… My extended family.


171
00:10:22.672 --> 00:10:23.442
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: But, yeah.


172
00:10:24.322 --> 00:10:26.812
Sarah Stuckey Coates: It would be nice if they were right down the street.


173
00:10:26.812 --> 00:10:28.371
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: It sure would be.


174
00:10:29.452 --> 00:10:30.241
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: I'm so jealous.


175
00:10:30.242 --> 00:10:30.872
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Let's see.


176
00:10:31.162 --> 00:10:31.922
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: people.


177
00:10:32.362 --> 00:10:34.021
Sarah Stuckey Coates: I know, me too.


178
00:10:35.212 --> 00:10:47.471
Sarah Stuckey Coates: But people do say that the one-on-one time… I mean, I think looking at the bright side of it, like, the extended visits in the summer, or here, that's special, too. Like, if we lived together…


179
00:10:47.762 --> 00:10:51.091
Sarah Stuckey Coates: I mean, I think it would be better to live near each other, obviously, but…


180
00:10:51.332 --> 00:10:55.321
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Right. We really make that point and make it really special.


181
00:10:56.242 --> 00:10:56.612
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


182
00:10:56.612 --> 00:10:57.782
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: We don't fight.


183
00:10:58.382 --> 00:10:58.992
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


184
00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.242
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: ad.


185
00:11:01.752 --> 00:11:05.702
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Except for when Dad starts releasing a string of profanities.


186
00:11:05.872 --> 00:11:06.452
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah.


187
00:11:09.192 --> 00:11:10.612
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Where is Dad now?


188
00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:11.472
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Cut.


189
00:11:11.472 --> 00:11:15.891
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Okay, well, okay, I think that's good. So basically, I hear you saying…


190
00:11:16.372 --> 00:11:20.971
Sarah Stuckey Coates: That your healthcare support team is important, and that includes your exercise.


191
00:11:21.492 --> 00:11:29.342
Sarah Stuckey Coates: which we didn't talk about as much, but Zumba, and then your dance studio, which you've been involved with for your whole life, and started in many ways.


192
00:11:29.342 --> 00:11:30.942
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yep. For Linden.


193
00:11:32.212 --> 00:11:43.552
Sarah Stuckey Coates: And then, like, I know you have the younger friends around the neighborhood, very… you're very social in the walking distance around the neighborhood, parties and…


194
00:11:43.712 --> 00:11:44.922
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: I have water.


195
00:11:45.322 --> 00:11:45.992
Sarah Stuckey Coates: What?


196
00:11:45.992 --> 00:11:48.172
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: I have to have water to be happy.


197
00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:52.762
Sarah Stuckey Coates: And water is a person.


198
00:11:52.992 --> 00:11:53.882
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yes.


199
00:11:54.952 --> 00:12:02.851
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yes, water is essential to life. And then… let's see, what about Nancy, though? You didn't talk about Nance.


200
00:12:04.022 --> 00:12:10.982
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Nancy is a very, very, very good friend, and I… I love her… I love her to the moon and back.


201
00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:20.592
Sarah Stuckey Coates: You drifted in the… lately. And she's out there on the island, and…


202
00:12:20.592 --> 00:12:23.022
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: It's out there on the island, and


203
00:12:25.152 --> 00:12:31.631
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah, and her family is very important. She's very close to her family and stuff, and…


204
00:12:32.382 --> 00:12:35.082
Sarah Stuckey Coates: And they're all… 3 kids are here, with all their kids.


205
00:12:35.082 --> 00:12:39.762
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah, with all their kids, and she has her sisters, and


206
00:12:40.212 --> 00:12:43.661
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: I don't know. Like, she doesn't just call me up to chat.


207
00:12:44.062 --> 00:12:45.381
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Oh, yeah.


208
00:12:45.382 --> 00:12:48.192
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Last night, Catlin just called me up to chat.


209
00:12:48.192 --> 00:12:49.212
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


210
00:12:49.212 --> 00:12:50.302
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Just, hi!


211
00:12:50.592 --> 00:12:52.431
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah, checking in.


212
00:12:52.842 --> 00:12:53.972

213
00:12:54.862 --> 00:12:55.862
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


214
00:12:56.042 --> 00:13:00.152
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: You know, it's… She's not as present, I guess.


215
00:13:00.152 --> 00:13:02.262
Sarah Stuckey Coates: I was present, but she is there.


216
00:13:02.262 --> 00:13:03.882
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yes, she's there.


217
00:13:03.882 --> 00:13:06.242
Sarah Stuckey Coates: In a great way, when you need her.


218
00:13:06.242 --> 00:13:06.792
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah.


219
00:13:06.792 --> 00:13:07.452
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


220
00:13:07.662 --> 00:13:08.302
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah.


221
00:13:09.542 --> 00:13:11.761
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: And she's not doing so hot right now.


222
00:13:11.972 --> 00:13:14.002
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah. Academy.


223
00:13:14.292 --> 00:13:15.182
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Anyway…


224
00:13:15.182 --> 00:13:26.211
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah, so… let's see… And then, I feel like there's something we were missing. Oh, Jason and Chrissy.


225
00:13:27.232 --> 00:13:31.122
Sarah Stuckey Coates: And, your brother…


226
00:13:31.582 --> 00:13:32.722
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Right?


227
00:13:34.282 --> 00:13:36.802
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Who, at this…


228
00:13:36.802 --> 00:13:37.752
Sarah Stuckey Coates: older.


229
00:13:38.112 --> 00:13:43.922
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah, he's much older, and in this point in my life,


230
00:13:45.542 --> 00:13:49.002
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Wow, it's really raining and the wind is blowing.


231
00:13:50.492 --> 00:14:00.271
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: I called him up, like, 2 days ago just to talk to him, and it was the first time he actually engaged in a conversation with me in a long time.


232
00:14:01.462 --> 00:14:02.831
Sarah Stuckey Coates: How did that feel?


233
00:14:03.252 --> 00:14:04.102
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Good!


234
00:14:04.352 --> 00:14:07.841
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah. What was… what'd you… what was it about?


235
00:14:07.842 --> 00:14:14.421
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Well, just not… not really much at all, but just usually he's like, if I ask a question that he can't…


236
00:14:14.762 --> 00:14:18.841
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: you know, he doesn't feel like talking about, he just gives the phone to Gob.


237
00:14:21.672 --> 00:14:26.721
Sarah Stuckey Coates: He hasn't always done that, though. That's… I mean, he's, like, 90… how old? 90…


238
00:14:26.722 --> 00:14:27.412
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: He's pushing.


239
00:14:27.412 --> 00:14:28.832
Sarah Stuckey Coates: too, right?


240
00:14:30.132 --> 00:14:33.112
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: If I'm gonna be 76, and he's…


241
00:14:34.842 --> 00:14:38.162
Sarah Stuckey Coates: 14 years old. Yeah, he's 90, right?


242
00:14:38.162 --> 00:14:40.432
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: It's gonna be 90 in January, I think.


243
00:14:40.432 --> 00:14:41.112
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


244
00:14:41.522 --> 00:14:42.152
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah.


245
00:14:43.212 --> 00:14:45.892
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Well, okay, should we go to the next question, then?


246
00:14:45.892 --> 00:14:47.942
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Well, I'm sort of somebody who…


247
00:14:48.292 --> 00:14:52.021
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: I don't know. I'm sort of a younger sister, I guess.


248
00:14:52.552 --> 00:14:53.282
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


249
00:14:54.022 --> 00:14:58.861
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah, I mean, it's not like I depend on him for much these days.


250
00:14:59.692 --> 00:15:00.662
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


251
00:15:00.842 --> 00:15:03.092
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Or… Just personal history.


252
00:15:03.262 --> 00:15:04.242
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah.


253
00:15:04.732 --> 00:15:11.262
Sarah Stuckey Coates: You feel like that's important, personal history, or is… Are new friends as important?


254
00:15:13.342 --> 00:15:15.582
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Oh, of course it's important.


255
00:15:16.492 --> 00:15:17.492
Sarah Stuckey Coates: It's… Yeah.


256
00:15:17.492 --> 00:15:21.202
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Not something that supports me in my life right now.


257
00:15:21.922 --> 00:15:22.732
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


258
00:15:22.732 --> 00:15:27.542
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: you know, psychologically. I mean… quite honestly.


259
00:15:27.692 --> 00:15:28.502
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


260
00:15:28.502 --> 00:15:34.701
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: I mean, he's present in my life, and I love him, of course, and we have all that personal history.


261
00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:38.702
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: You know, from before I was…


262
00:15:39.662 --> 00:15:42.272
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: You know, when I was a little kid.


263
00:15:42.642 --> 00:15:43.602
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


264
00:15:43.602 --> 00:15:50.821
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: And, of course, you know, our kids and their kids and all that stuff.


265
00:15:51.392 --> 00:15:52.012
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: But…


266
00:15:52.012 --> 00:15:52.672
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


267
00:15:52.882 --> 00:15:59.152
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: I mean… Yeah, and I think he's glad that I have a decent life.


268
00:16:00.212 --> 00:16:02.492
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah, of course, he cares.


269
00:16:02.492 --> 00:16:04.381
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: And that I'm, you know…


270
00:16:04.752 --> 00:16:08.522
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: I'm… have a good roof over my head and all that stuff, you know what I mean?


271
00:16:08.522 --> 00:16:09.082
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


272
00:16:09.082 --> 00:16:15.531
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: And my kids are happy, and their kids are happy, and… You know, all that.


273
00:16:16.172 --> 00:16:16.702
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


274
00:16:16.702 --> 00:16:20.592
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: I think that gives him, you know, relief, or what all that.


275
00:16:21.212 --> 00:16:23.962
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: But…


276
00:16:29.312 --> 00:16:32.372
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: You know… Yeah.


277
00:16:33.372 --> 00:16:34.182
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah.


278
00:16:34.862 --> 00:16:36.421
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: And he's far away.


279
00:16:37.222 --> 00:16:38.042
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


280
00:16:38.042 --> 00:16:40.002
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: And politically right now.


281
00:16:41.232 --> 00:16:43.572
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: That's all so uncomfortable.


282
00:16:44.132 --> 00:16:45.072
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


283
00:16:46.512 --> 00:16:47.492
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


284
00:16:47.862 --> 00:16:49.261
Sarah Stuckey Coates: That makes it hard.


285
00:16:49.472 --> 00:16:50.232
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah.


286
00:16:52.752 --> 00:17:06.661
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: So that's another thing I was just thinking about on this, because, you know, this relationship thing is that it… things change, and that's something that you want to look, you guys, for the summary.


287
00:17:06.972 --> 00:17:12.431
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: The survey, like, people do have phases of life, and…


288
00:17:14.011 --> 00:17:22.492
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: There are certain people that are continual in your life, depending on circumstances, life and death and divorces and…


289
00:17:23.031 --> 00:17:26.951
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Disease, and, you know, things shift.


290
00:17:27.752 --> 00:17:28.692
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


291
00:17:28.692 --> 00:17:29.491
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah.


292
00:17:30.812 --> 00:17:37.762
Sarah Stuckey Coates: And is that, once you make peace with that, that's as a fact of life.


293
00:17:38.252 --> 00:17:39.482
Sarah Stuckey Coates: That's good.


294
00:17:39.662 --> 00:17:40.522
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Good point.


295
00:17:40.522 --> 00:17:41.751
Sarah Stuckey Coates: It's okay, but…


296
00:17:41.752 --> 00:17:42.102
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah.


297
00:17:42.102 --> 00:17:45.421
Sarah Stuckey Coates: cling on. It can cause struggle, and…


298
00:17:45.422 --> 00:17:50.392
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah, and unhappiness, and stress, and alcoholism.


299
00:17:50.392 --> 00:17:56.092
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah. Like, I remember grammar going around town and having so much fun.


300
00:17:56.312 --> 00:18:08.151
Sarah Stuckey Coates: I mean, she always said family was the most important thing, and she acted that way, but she also just loved leaving us and going around talking to the postman and the random tourist at the grocery store, or whatever.


301
00:18:08.152 --> 00:18:08.712
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah.


302
00:18:08.712 --> 00:18:15.902
Sarah Stuckey Coates: I mean, not that those were her support, but just being able to go out and meet new people, or see people that…


303
00:18:16.802 --> 00:18:17.452
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: She didn't know.


304
00:18:17.452 --> 00:18:21.282
Sarah Stuckey Coates: well, but saw them every day for, like, decades, or, you know…


305
00:18:21.282 --> 00:18:30.891
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Right, and there's so much about that where you just go out into the world, and you smile at somebody at the grocery store who smiles back at you.


306
00:18:30.892 --> 00:18:31.472
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


307
00:18:31.472 --> 00:18:32.791
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: That's huge.


308
00:18:32.792 --> 00:18:34.551
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah. That is… I did.


309
00:18:34.552 --> 00:18:36.082
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: That is huge.


310
00:18:36.082 --> 00:18:37.052
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


311
00:18:37.052 --> 00:18:37.752
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: that…


312
00:18:37.752 --> 00:18:38.592
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Good one.


313
00:18:38.592 --> 00:18:44.921
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: what does… what that does to your heart, you know? And if you're in a community that is…


314
00:18:45.362 --> 00:18:47.292
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Holy God, you know?


315
00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:51.982
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Awful, right?


316
00:18:52.582 --> 00:18:53.752
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Yeah.


317
00:18:53.752 --> 00:18:58.582
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah. Or you get on a bus, or… Whatever.


318
00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:04.571
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Okay, let's go to the next question.


319
00:19:05.112 --> 00:19:13.662
Sarah Stuckey Coates: All of us have multiple identities that contribute to who we are. For example, I might say mother, wife, daughter, teacher, foodie.


320
00:19:14.342 --> 00:19:20.111
Sarah Stuckey Coates: What roles, and identities.


321
00:19:21.672 --> 00:19:29.772
Sarah Stuckey Coates: feel important to who you are. These might be related to your family, work, hobbies, or community life.


322
00:19:32.772 --> 00:19:36.952
Sarah Stuckey Coates: What roles or identities feel important to who you are?


323
00:19:38.062 --> 00:19:42.402
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: And, I'm a tree hugger.


324
00:19:45.372 --> 00:19:49.431
Sarah Stuckey Coates: But so funny, I was just clearing out my old email this morning.


325
00:19:49.432 --> 00:19:49.952
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah.


326
00:19:49.952 --> 00:20:01.402
Sarah Stuckey Coates: And I… it was asking me to mass delete a Yahoo account where I send a lot of junk, but used to be my primary, and there was a picture of you with a whole bunch of different age people around you.


327
00:20:01.402 --> 00:20:01.892
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Yeah.


328
00:20:01.892 --> 00:20:08.862
Sarah Stuckey Coates: And it was like, if no one talks about this, nothing good will happen. And it was like, we're treehuggers. It was, like, all these kids with signs.


329
00:20:09.282 --> 00:20:12.911
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Drew my… it was on a stage. I don't know what it was.


330
00:20:13.302 --> 00:20:16.021
Sarah Stuckey Coates: Hi, yeah, you're a G-Hugger.


331
00:20:20.802 --> 00:20:21.792
Sarah Stuckey Coates: What?


332
00:20:21.792 --> 00:20:26.331
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: I guess initially, I guess… I don't know, the way I was brought up.


333
00:20:27.002 --> 00:20:30.761
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: In my… my little family on Craigie Street.


334
00:20:30.992 --> 00:20:33.791
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Norwood Street, Craigie Street, whatever.


335
00:20:36.412 --> 00:20:39.311
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: My parents always brought joy to people.


336
00:20:42.512 --> 00:20:44.022

339
00:21:00.832 --> 00:21:06.992
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Not teasing, but,


340
00:21:11.852 --> 00:21:13.442
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: How do I want to say it?


341
00:21:16.702 --> 00:21:22.662
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: my dad would say to people that he, like, when I would bring a new boyfriend home.


342
00:21:24.142 --> 00:21:25.811
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: Glad to meet you, champ!


343
00:21:29.642 --> 00:21:33.631
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: laugh or smile, you know? I mean, it wasn't like…

350
00:21:42.342 --> 00:21:44.132
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: It would just be…


351
00:21:48.462 --> 00:21:49.702
Michelle’s iPhonemichelle stuckey: You know…


352
00:21:50.632 --> 00:21:54.731
